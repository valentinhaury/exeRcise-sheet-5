# Planning a city trip around Europe

## Exercise 1: Discovering Barcelona (4 Points)

### a)

```{r}
#this codeblock extracts the geospatial data in bbmatrix and polygon format
bb_matrix <- getbb("Barcelona", format_out = "matrix")
bb_polygon <- getbb("Barcelona", format_out = "sf_polygon")
bb_multipolygon <- bb_polygon$multipolygon
```
While the bounding box matrix is easier to compute, the polygon format allows for more details and accuracy.

### b)
  
```{r}
#creates a non-interactive map of Barcelona
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(bb_multipolygon) +
  tm_borders(col = "darkblue") +
  tm_layout(title = "Non-interactive map of Barcelona")
```

```{r}
#creates an interactive map of Barcelona
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(bb_multipolygon) +
  tm_borders(col = "darkblue") +
  tm_layout(title = "Interactive map of Barcelona")
```

### c) 
While interactive maps are great for use in an online setting because they allow zooming
and scrolling they loose all their abilities in document-formats like pdf or paper.


### d) 
	
```{r}
#getting the museum data and displaying it as red dots on the OpenStreetMap
museums <- opq(bbox = bb_matrix) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "tourism", value = "museum") %>%
  osmdata_sf()

museum_points <- museums$osm_points

tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(museum_points) +
  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap") +
  tm_symbols(col = "red", size = 0.2, fill = "red") +
  tm_layout(title = "Museums in Barcelona")
```


### e)
	
```{r}
# filter for museums with a name
museum_points_named <- museum_points %>%
  filter(!is.na(name) & name != "")

# calculate the middle of the map
coords <- st_coordinates(museum_points_named)

museum_points_named <- museum_points_named %>%
  mutate(lon = coords[,1], lat = coords[,2])

center_lon <- mean(bb_matrix[1, ])
center_lat <- mean(bb_matrix[2, ])

# create the interactive map
leaflet(museum_points_named) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  setView(lng = center_lon, lat = center_lat, zoom = 12) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat,
    color = "red",
    popup = ~name
  )
```


## Exercise 2: Finding Accommodation in Berlin (5 Points)

### a)

Tag: tourism=hostel

[OSM-Wiki-tourism=hostel](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:tourism%3Dhostel)

### b)  

```{r}
# get berlin data
bbox_berlin <- getbb("Berlin, Germany")

# get only hostels
hostels_berlin <- opq(bbox = bbox_berlin) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "tourism", value = "hostel") %>%
  osmdata_sf()

# count the different variabls and sum
n_hostels_points <- nrow(hostels_berlin$osm_points)
n_hostels_polygons <- nrow(hostels_berlin$osm_polygons)
n_hostels_lines <- nrow(hostels_berlin$osm_lines)

total_hostels <- n_hostels_polygons + n_hostels_points

```

In Berlin are between `r n_hostels_points` and `r total_hostels` hostels. If a hostel is listed as a point only the location is available. If a hostel is listed
as a polygon there is also an additional information about the shape of the hostel on the map available. 
Because i am not sure if a hostel can be listed as a point and a polygon at the same time i put the number of total hostels as a range to cover
all possible combinations.
Lines are used for linear features like borders or rivers and buildings are not linear.

### c) 

```{r}
# sums over the different variables
n_with_name <- sum(!is.na(hostels_berlin$osm_points$name))

n_with_name_and_beds <- sum(!is.na(hostels_berlin$osm_points$name) & !is.na(hostels_berlin$osm_points$beds))
```

There are `r n_with_name` hostels with a name and of those `r n_with_name_and_beds` also have information about the number of beds.

### d) 

	
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# filter hostel with a name and information about the internet access and create a interactive map
hostel_points_filtered <- hostels_berlin$osm_points %>%
  filter(!is.na(internet_access) & !is.na(name))

tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(hostel_points_filtered) +
  tm_dots(
    col = "internet_access",
    id = "name",
    palette = "Set2"
  ) +
  tm_layout(
    title = "Hostels in Berlin by Internet Access",
    legend.outside = TRUE
  )

```

### e)

```{r}
# filter hostels with a name, look for wheelchair variable and filter for that variable beeing not empty
named_hostel_points <- hostels_berlin$osm_points %>%
  filter(!is.na(name))

str(named_hostel_points[, 78:79])

wheelchair_description_available <- named_hostel_points %>%
  filter(!is.na(wheelchair))

```

```{r}
# create a bar plot witht the wheelchair variable
ggplot(wheelchair_description_available, aes(x = wheelchair, fill = wheelchair)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("yes" = "green", "limited" = "orange", "no" = "red"),
    name = "Wheelchair Access",
    labels = c("yes" = "full accessibility", "limited" = "limited accessibility", "no" = "no accessibility")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Wheelchair-Accessibility of Hostels in Berlin",
    x = "Accessibility Level",
    y = "Number of Hostels"
  )
```

### f)

```{r}
# select the hear of gold hostel
heart_of_gold <- named_hostel_points %>%
  filter(name == "Heart of Gold Hostel Berlin")

heart_of_gold[, 1:15]

```

The Heart of gold Hostel has an entrance in the bike and bed column, that means it is certified by the adfc to be a good hostel for cyclists.

## Exercise 3: It's coming home (6 Points)

### a) 

```{r}
# read all the data for the matches
#matches <- read_csv("https://github.com/jfjelstul/englishfootball/blob/master/data-csv/matches.csv")
matches <- read_csv("data\\matches.csv")
# add home and away goals in the mactches group them by season and calculate the mean for goals per game
goals_per_season <- matches %>%
  mutate(total_goals = home_team_score + away_team_score) %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(avg_goals_per_game = mean(total_goals, na.rm = TRUE))
# create a line plot with the individual points showing the avg goals per game in each season
ggplot(goals_per_season, aes(x = season, y = avg_goals_per_game)) +
  geom_line(color = "lightblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Total Goals per Game in English Football",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Average Goals per Game"
  )

```

The plot shows the average number of goals per game(AGPG) on the y-achsis and the season on the x-achsis. In the earliest seasons the AGPG where the highest, from 1900 to 1925 the numbers between 2.75 and 3.1 rising again to a higher average until 1965 and then the AGPG stayed relatively consistent at around 2.6.


### b)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

goals_per_season <- matches %>%
  mutate(total_goals = home_team_score + away_team_score) %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(avg_goals_per_game = mean(total_goals, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = "drop")

# creating and saving an animated plot
animated_plot <- ggplot(goals_per_season, aes(x = season, y = avg_goals_per_game)) +
  geom_line(color = "lightblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Total Goals per Game in English Football over the years",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Average Goals per Game"
  ) +
  transition_reveal(season) +
  ease_aes('linear')


anim_save("avg_goals_per_season.gif", animation = animate(animated_plot, width = 800, height = 500, fps = 10))

```

![Animated Plot](avg_goals_per_season.gif)

I set eval=FALSE for all animated plots because something with the animation doesnt work in the Knitting process.
